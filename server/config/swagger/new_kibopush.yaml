  title: KiboPush API
  description: >
    Welcome to the KiboPush API documentation! Our API provides flexible tools
    that can be used in the creation of new, outstanding projects.

    Please note that this documentation refers to the OpenAPI 3.0 version.

    Build something great!

    ## Basic Usage

    All KiboPush API requests start with `https://kiboapi.cloudkibo.com/api/`

    The next segment of the URI path depends on the type of request. For example:

    `https://kiboapi.cloudkibo.com/api/users/`

    to get information of logged in user.

    ## Authentication

    In order for client application to call our API, he/she would have to attach the following information to the http headers:
      * app_id (the API key)
      * app_secret (the API key secret)
    ## Error Handling

    Errors are returned using standard HTTP error code syntax. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error (bad or missing parameters, not authenticated etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with KiboPushâ€™s servers. Any additional info is included in the body of the return call, JSON-formatted.

            ref id with subscriberâ€™s ref id to know who that person was who
            filled the form using checkbox. Ecommerce owners should store this
            ref id in their system against each order record or customer record
            depending on their business logic. Next time, when the customer who
            filled the form responds on Messenger, you will get all the facebook

            compile the whole information.
